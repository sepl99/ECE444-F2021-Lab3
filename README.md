**Activity 5 (Education Pathways Feedback)**

Functional Requirement
The application should allow a user to add individual courses to a selection/list of courses that they can save.

At the moment it purely displays information about specific courses, but users are not able to create groups of courses that they are able to save.



Non-Functional Requirement
The application should have user-selectable wep page colour themes.

For the purposes of usability, it would be good if the user were able to select a different colour theme for the page. For example many people find dark themed pages to be less harsh on their eyes at night or in dark lighting environments. This would be a simple feature to implement and could improve the page usability significantly depending on the user.
